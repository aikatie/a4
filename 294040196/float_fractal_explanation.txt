After changing all the variables of type double to type float, we noticed that the performance increased drastically. For example, the output from the original fractal.cu with the dimensions 320 x 200 and 10 frames would result in a runtime of 0.0004 seconds while the output from the modified float_fractal.cu with those same dimensions and frames resulted in a runtime of 0.0002 seconds. This meant that changing all types to float would approximately halve the runtime.
