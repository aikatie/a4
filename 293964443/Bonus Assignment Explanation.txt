When switching the variables to floats, it caused a decrease in the runtime leading to a quicker execution. This could be due to floats taking up less memory (4 bytes vs double taking up 8 bytes) which leads to less memory being taken up for the numbers being processed. A lot of GPUs are also optimized for floating-point operations, which could also explain the increase in time. The drawback to this though is that floats have decreased accuracy compared to doubles, which can lead to a less accurate fractal being drawn.
